			What is a resistor
		</h2>
		<p>
			Resistors restrict or limit the flow of current in a circuit. The ability of a material or component to resist current flow is measured in ohms. There are three main types of resistor:
			1.fixed resistors
            2.variable resistors
            3.special resistors, such as thermistors and light-dependent resistors (LDRs)
			Although resistors come in a variety of sizes and shapes, the most common type of resistor for hobby electronics is the carbon film resistor. These resistors consist of a layer of carbon laid down on an insulating material and contained in a small cylinder, with wire leads attached to both ends. The resistor itself is about 1/4â€³ long, and the leads are about an inch long, making the entire thing about 2-1/4 inches long.

		<h3>
		What are resistors used for?
		</h3>
		<p>
			The higher the value of the resistor the smaller/lower the flow of current. Resistors are used for regulating current and they resist the current flow and the extent to which they do this is measured in ohms. Resistors are found in almost every electronic circuit.
