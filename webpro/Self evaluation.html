		Carrying out this assignments was not the easiest of tasks for me but i still worked my way through it. I think the most challenging aspect of this assignment was , trying to get a link between drop-down selection box and the canvas colour fill in the rectangle, and my least challenging was actually making each webpage with headers and footer and the basic requirements. I can truthfully say I have learnt a lot on how to use JavaScript with in a HTML file and a CSS file also, for example putting a picture into the webpage, may seem to be the easiest task of them all but at first I struggled but I eventually understood how it worked. Another example, a much trickier one was connecting the physical band representation to the   drop down menus and also connecting the drop downs to its final resistance value. Personally i would like to think that I have achieved this even though it was not specified which method we had to go about it, I still think this is a viable method.

		And finally according to the presentation and effort and countless hours and nights ( I am currently typing this up at 04:36am if thats not commitment Martin I dont know what is ) I would like to think this is up to Grade B standard and I hope I have achieved that here i have also tried my upmost best as this assignment and it has taken hard work and dedication to even reach this point. My lack of understanding of JavaScript made me realise I had to learn and research a lot more than most students in the class but I pushed through it and I have gained some valuable lessons which have bettered my understanding of the subject.
